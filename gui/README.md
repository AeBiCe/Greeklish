# Greeklish GUI version
Windows Renames Greek filenames to "Greeklish" ..now through a gui!

## How to use
Run the windows executable `Greeklish.exe`.
Browse or manually enter the directory with the files you wish to translate. Tick the checkbox if you wish to translate
files in the subfoldes as well. Lastly, press **Translate** and enjoy your Greeklish named files.

**Note:** Non-Greek names will not be affected.

## Knwon Issues
* Can't enter directory manually, you have to use the browse button
* Doesn't translate files if you change filename while choosing directory
