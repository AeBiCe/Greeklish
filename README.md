# Greeklish
Renames Greek filenames to "Greeklish"

## How to use
clone or download repo and run `main.py`.
Enter the directory path with the files you wish to rename. The program will then recursively iterate through the directory
and translate files with Greek filenames to Greeklish. Optionally it can also translate file in subfolders as well. 

**Note:** Non-Greek names will not be affected.
