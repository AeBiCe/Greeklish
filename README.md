# Greeklish
Renames Greek filenames to "Greeklish".

There are currently two types of Greeklish, terminal based and a gui. For more information about the gui check the [/gui](gui) folder. 

## How to use
Clone or download repo and run `main.py` for terminal version. Alternatively run `Greeklish.exe` for the gui.
Enter the directory path with the files you wish to rename. The program will then recursively iterate through the directory
and translate files with Greek filenames to Greeklish. Optionally it can also translate files in subfolders as well. 

**Note:** Non-Greek names will not be affected.

## Knwon Issues
* Can only translate files on NTFS drives
