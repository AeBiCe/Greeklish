## Objective
Rename Greek filenames to "Greeklish".

## How to use
Clone or download repo and run `main.py` for terminal version. Alternatively run `Greeklish.exe` for the gui.
Enter the directory path with the files you wish to rename. The program will then recursively iterate through the directory
and translate files with Greek filenames to Greeklish. Optionally it can also translate files in subfolders as well. 

**Note:** Non-Greek names will not be affected.

## Knwon Issues
* Can only translate files on NTFS drives
